# Music project

For this project, I wanted to take inspiration from the song recommenders that already exist on sites such as spotify, youtube or soundcloud.

To practice web scraping, I first scraped two web pages featuring a list of top songs to add it to the song recommender.

Using the api, I then created a list of over 10000 songs on spotify, along with their audio characteristics, and grouped them into different clusters.

I then developed a song recommender that allows me to recommend a song likely to please based on its audio features similar to those of the songs in the same cluster.
